            <h1>What is a Hamster?</h1>
            <p>Hamsters are small, nocturnal rodents native to Europe, Asia and North Africa. There are about 19 species of Hamster in the world, the most popular being the Syrian Hamster. These cute mice have a short tail and a body covered with fur so they are also called bobtail mice.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Origin
                <br>
                Hamsters do not belong to the Arvicolinae subfamily such as rats, mice, hamsters... which carry many pathogens and destroy crops, but belong to the Cricetidae subfamily, also known as tailless rats of the rodent family. They live in the wild, in deserts, semi-deserts, or temperate climates; They often dig burrows to catch insects and have two cheek pouches to store food.</p>

            <p>
                This species of rat was discovered in 1829 and was used by experimenters to study scientific experiments. After many years, due to the impact of the environment and genetic breeding, hamsters gradually interact closely with humans. With its intelligence and neat lifestyle, Hamsters gradually become a cute pet admired by many people.

                2. Appearance
                <br>
                This species of mouse is very small, only 5-15cm tall, weighs 25-200g depending on the species, and can fit in the palm of your hand. They have soft, shiny fur covering their bodies in many different colors and a round appearance like a moving cotton ball. Long teeth, large incisors specialized for gnawing, cheeks always bulging to store food. Hamsters are different from other rodents in that their tails are very short, many species even have their tails amputated, and their ears and legs are also much smaller than hamsters and mice.

                3. Behavior
                <br>                
                Hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they love to sleep during the day and hate being woken up. In the wild, they dig burrows to hide and live, and also to store food reserves. Living in a cave helps them stay cool no matter how harsh the outside environment is. Wild hamsters will often hoard food and hibernate.
                <br>
                4. Living environment
                <br>
                This species loves to live in warm, dry areas such as steppes, sand dunes or desert edges. If you keep a mouse in your home, you need to pay attention to the temperature issue.
                <br>
                5. Habit
                <br>
                Most hamsters live sociably and in groups, but a few choose a solitary lifestyle, are highly territorial and hate being violated by others. Male Hamsters often bite each other to death, so people usually do not keep males together.</p>
